# Region growing segementation

This script is a python implementation of the region growing algorithm used for segmentation of unstructured point clouds. The code was derived from the [Point Cloud Library](https://pcl.readthedocs.io/projects/tutorials/en/latest/region_growing_segmentation.html#).
A sample model is provided with point cloud and mesh.
